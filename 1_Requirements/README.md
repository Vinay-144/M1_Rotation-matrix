# Problem statement
Used in image processing 
To determine transformed co-ordinates
,robotics to determine 
 To determine end effector position, robotic arm position.

# Approach
* Create a switch case where user selects to convert from reference co-ordinates to rotated co-ordinates or viceversa.
* Create matrix header function that takes in either reference co-ordinates or rotated co-ordinates.
 -In X,Y,Z for reference co-ordinates.
 -In U,V,W for rotated co-ordinates.
* Create matrix
