# M1_ROTATION_MATRIX.
*Transformation matrix which operates on a position vector in a 3-D euclidean space and maps the rotated co-ordinates(OUVW) onto reference axis(OXYZ).
 where 
     * O     : Origin
     * X,Y,Z : reference co-ordinates along X,Y,Z axis.
     * U,V,W : rotated co-ordinates along U,V,Z axis.
